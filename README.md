# Sleep-Health-and-Lifestyle

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the impact of various lifestyle and demographic factors on sleep health using a structured dataset. The objective is to uncover patterns and build insights that could help individuals and professionals improve sleep quality and overall well-being.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes features such as:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Occupation**
- **Sleep Duration**
- **Quality of Sleep**
- **Physical Activity Level**
- **Stress Level**
- **BMI Category**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Daily Steps**
- **Sleep Disorder**

The data was analyzed to explore correlations and predictive patterns for sleep disorders and sleep quality.

## ✅ Objectives

- Understand the distribution of lifestyle and demographic features.
- Explore correlations between lifestyle choices and sleep health.
- Identify potential indicators of sleep disorders.
- Provide visualizations for better understanding.
- Recommend lifestyle changes for better sleep quality.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (if applicable)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Distribution plots and bar graphs  

3. **Insights and Observations**  
   - Relationship between stress and sleep disorders  
   - Activity levels and sleep quality  
   - Sleep patterns across age and gender groups  

## 📈 Visualization Highlights

- Heatmaps for correlation between variables.
- Boxplots and bar charts to compare sleep disorders by occupation, stress, and activity.
- Pie charts to show distribution of sleep disorders.

## 💡 Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that stress level, physical activity, and lifestyle habits significantly influence sleep health. Targeted interventions in these areas may help reduce sleep-related issues and improve overall quality of life.

## 📄 Recommendations

- Maintain regular physical activity to improve sleep quality.
- Reduce stress through relaxation techniques.
- Monitor daily steps and heart rate for balanced lifestyle.
- Target awareness programs at high-risk occupations.
